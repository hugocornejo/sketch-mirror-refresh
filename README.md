# Mirror Refresh

A little plugin to force [Sketch Mirror](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/features/#mirror) to refresh the whole screen, for those situations when Mirror gets a little bit lazy and refuses to update the last actions.

Maybe it's just a placebo effect but I realised that chaning the name of the current Artboard seems to make Sketch refresh the whole thing thinking it's a new Artboard. That's exactly what this plugin does.

## Installation
1. [Download the ZIP](https://github.com/hugocornejo/sketch-mirror-refresh/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the contents and double click **Mirror Refresh.sketchplugin** to install it.

## Usage

**Plugins / Mirror Refresh** or **⌥⌘R**
